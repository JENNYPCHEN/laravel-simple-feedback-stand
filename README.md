<h1>mini project: smiley feedback button with laravel </h1>
<p>A playful way to experience Laravel framework </p>
<p>The initial objective for this project is to, hopefully put a little smile on my interviewer (afterall, whether we get the job or not, we should always be thankful for the time they spend with us for the interview, don't you think :P)
